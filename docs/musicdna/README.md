# MusicDNA

Local working folder for the MusicDNA product thesis, ontology, diagnostic canon, and future pairing graph.

## Principle

We are not building a catalog of songs. We are building a catalog of revealing decisions.

The pairing is the IP. MusicDNA should not begin by generating thousands of mediocre pairings. It should begin by building a strong ontology, a focused diagnostic anchor set, and a smaller set of highly revealing matchups.

The app is not learning songs. It is learning tradeoffs.

The current strongest candidate dimension expansion is `immersion`: immediacy vs slow reveal. Example: choosing `Breaking Into Heaven` over `She Bangs the Drums` may reveal immersion over immediacy, journey over anthem, and atmosphere over hook.

## Lane Contract

MusicDNA separates routing lanes from diagnostic sub-lanes:

- `songs.primary_lane` is the top-level route: `alternative`, `pop`, `hip_hop`, `electronic`, `classic_rock`, or `general`.
- `songs.lane` is the granular catalog lane, such as `post_punk_new_wave`, `goth_darkwave`, `shoegaze_dreampop`, or `manchester_indie_dance`.
- `pairings.lane` matches the top-level route and should be validated against both songs' `primary_lane`.

This means `Ceremony` can remain `post_punk_new_wave`, `A Forest` can remain `goth_darkwave`, and their pairings can still correctly route through `alternative`.
