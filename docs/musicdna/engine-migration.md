# MusicDNA Engine — Migration Plan

The engine is being extracted from `src/lib/musicdna.functions.ts` into a
transport-agnostic service under `src/musicdna/engine/`. Web (via
`createServerFn`), the upcoming `/api/v1/*` REST layer (for Flutter and any
future client), and tests all call the **same** engine. No duplicate
implementations, ever.

## Layout

```
src/musicdna/
  engine/        pure domain — no Supabase/LLM/React imports
    types.ts     DTOs shared with adapters, routes, and clients
    ports.ts     SupabaseGateway, LLMGateway, Clock, Rng interfaces
    scoring.ts   ✅ migrated — pure vector math (dot, cosine, tiers)
    archetypes.ts ✅ migrated — assignment, margin, flag reasons, tier
    reveal.ts     ✅ migrated (public share) — buildPublicReveal DTO
    priors.ts     ✅ migrated — seedVectorFromPriors (opening-3 seeding)
    descriptors.ts ✅ migrated — deriveDescriptors (mood read off axes)
    voice.ts      ✅ migrated — hedges, hesitation, hash-stable variant picks
    critic.ts       TODO — full prompt builder + LLM orchestration
    pairing.ts      TODO — selectNextPairing
    session.ts      TODO — startSession / getSession
    choice.ts       TODO — submitChoice (probe alignment, lane flips, vector update)
    index.ts        TODO — MusicDNAEngine factory: (deps) => { ... }
  adapters/
    supabase.ts     TODO — SupabaseGateway impl (user- or admin-scoped)
    llm.ts          TODO — LLMGateway impl over Lovable AI Gateway
```


## Rules for engine code

- No `import ... from "@/integrations/supabase/..."`.
- No `import ... from "@tanstack/react-start"`.
- No React, no DOM, no `process.env` reads.
- All I/O goes through a port. All time comes from `Clock`. All randomness
  comes from `Rng`.
- Failures are typed (`EngineError`); routes/server-fns translate them to
  HTTP or thrown `Error`s.

## Migration order (each step keeps web working)

1. ✅ Engine skeleton + `scoring.ts` + tests.
2. ✅ `archetypes.ts` + tests — pure assignment, margin, flag reasons.
3. ✅ `reveal.ts` (public share) + tests, and `GET /api/v1/share/:token`.
4. ✅ `share.functions.ts` and `finalizeSessionImpl` now import
   `buildPublicReveal` / `assignArchetype` from the engine — web and REST
   share one code path for scoring, margin, and public share DTOs.
5. ✅ REST v1 surface for the interactive loop: `POST /api/v1/session`,
   `GET /api/v1/session/:id/next`, `POST /api/v1/session/:id/choice`,
   `POST /api/v1/session/:id/reveal`. Routes verify Supabase bearer via
   `_auth.ts` and delegate to the same `*Impl` helpers the web server
   functions call. Zero duplicate implementation.
6. ✅ Extracted the deterministic reveal-time helpers into the engine:
   `priors.ts` (seedVectorFromPriors), `descriptors.ts` (mood read),
   `voice.ts` (hedge ladder, hesitation copy, `pickByHash`, `dimSeed`).
   `musicdna.functions.ts` re-exports from the engine — one implementation.
   Test count now 41 passing.
7. **Next**: extract `critic.ts` (full prompt building + LLM gateway) and
   `pairing.ts` / `session.ts` / `choice.ts` from `musicdna.functions.ts`
   into pure engine modules behind ports. Routes/server-fns become 3-line
   wrappers, and golden-fixture tests can pin the interactive loop.



## Testing

`bun test` runs the engine test suite. Engine tests use in-memory
`SupabaseGateway` and scripted `LLMGateway` fakes — no network, no DB.
