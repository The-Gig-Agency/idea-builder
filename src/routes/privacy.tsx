            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              We collect the information you give us: the songs you name during onboarding, the choices you make in side-by-sides, and any messages you send to the critic. If you create an account, we also store your email address through our authentication provider.
            </p>

            <h2 className="display text-2xl mb-3">How we use it</h2>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              Your song choices and reactions power the analysis that produces your read. We do not sell your data. We do not use it to target ads. We may use aggregated, anonymized patterns to improve the quality of pairings and interpretations.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section>
            <h2 className="display text-2xl mb-3">What we share</h2>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              When you generate a share link, we create a public, anonymized snapshot of your session that anyone with the link can view. You control when that link is created and who sees it. We do not otherwise share your individual data with third parties.
            </p>

            <h2 className="display text-2xl mb-3">Cookies and analytics</h2>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              We use minimal first-party cookies to keep you signed in and to remember anonymous sessions. We may use privacy-preserving analytics to understand how the app is used in aggregate — never to track you individually across sites.
            </p>

          <section>
            <h2 className="display text-2xl mb-3">Retention and deletion</h2>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              We keep your session data and profile for as long as your account exists, or until you delete it. Anonymous sessions may be purged after extended inactivity. You can request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us.
            </p>

            <h2 className="display text-2xl mb-3">Your rights</h2>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              You can access, export, or delete your data by contacting us. If you have an account, you can also delete your profile through the app. We aim to honor requests within 30 days.

            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              We use industry-standard practices to protect your data: encrypted connections, access controls, and regular security reviews. No system is perfectly secure, and we encourage responsible disclosure of any vulnerabilities you discover.
